    "# Step 1: Edge-aware smoothing using a bilateral filter\n",
    "### Because a bilateral filter smooths flat regions while keeping edges sharp, it is ideally suited to convert an RGB image into a cartoon. Unfortunately, bilateral filters are orders of magnitudes slower than other smoothing operators (e.g., Gaussian blur). Thus, if speed is important, it might be a good idea to operate on a down-scaled version of the original image. However, even at a reduced scale the bilateral filter might still be horrendously slow. Another trick is therefore to repeatedly (say, seven times via num_bilateral=7) apply a small bilateral filter instead of applying a large bilateral filter once:# "

    "### OpenCV offers a variety of choices when it comes to edge detection. The beauty of adaptive thresholding is that it detects the most salient features in each (small) neighborhood of an image, independent of the overall properties of the image, which is exactly what we want when we seek to draw bold, black outlines around objects and people in a cartoon. However, this property also makes adaptive thresholding susceptible to noise. It is therefor a good idea to pre-process the image with a median filter, which replaces each pixel value with the median value of all the pixels in a small (e.g., 7 pixel) neighborhood:"
